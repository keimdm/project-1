# Recipe-Search-Application

## Description

This application was created for the purposes of assisting the user with making a choice on their drinking preference. This project was made because we understand how indecisive people can be in general so we wanted to create a website that can deal with that indecisiveness. We also wanted to create the project to assist people with finding different receipes of certain ingredients they would want, ex: having a drink that has strawberry and cider in it. The application solves the problem of not knowing what exact drink you want as well as finding a drink that you may want or find interesting considering the ingredients you specifically want. This application helped us to learn how to work on a project as a team, how to use GitHub as a team, and how to use multiple apis to create a unique function and project.

## Usage

In order to use this application, you will be able to write ingredients in the search bar. You can only put in one ingredient at a time. If you want to add multiple ingredients to filter out drinks that have those specific ingredients, put the ingredient in the search bar and please the "add" button to add the ingredients in a list. You can add as many ingredients as you want but the recipes will only show up if the recipes has all the ingredients in the list. After you have the ingredient(s) you want, press the "search" button to receive your results. The results will show the name of the drink, the ingredients it contains, the servings, and the instructions on the drink. You can press the clear to clear the list and enter a new set of ingredients or singular ingredient and press "search" to get a new set of results. The "help" button is there in case you need instructions on how to use the website. The page will also load with a random cocktail and its ingredients and instructions.
